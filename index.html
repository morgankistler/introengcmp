  <h2>I grew up in York, PA surrounded rolling fields and even worked on a farm for 3 years. I ended up in Pittsburgh mainly because my sister got her degree from Pitt, and I had no idea what I wanted to study or where I wanted to go. The past four years have been an adventure of figuring out my interests and passions, but I currently find technical writing, design, and research to be the most appealing.</h2>

         <h1>Why UX Design and Usability Testing? Where do you see yourself within this nexus of UX design and product development? </h1>
  <h2>I enjoy technical and research writing more than creative pieces or journalism. Simply put, I like learning how things (i.e., software, products) work and then writing about those things. I've become increasingly aware of how important design is when thinking about content delivery, so I am mainly interested in expanding my knowledge and understanding of how to best convey information.</h2>

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">   
         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2>I am currently trying to find a job in Pittsburgh in the technical writing field, though I am open to other kinds of coordination/communications positions. This path combines my interests in research and writing, allowing me to be in a role that draws on my creative and analytical skills. I am invigorated by the task of having to explain complex information to a broad audience while also making that information appealing at the same time. Generally, I think this kind of position and skill is important because we all need to be able to convey and receive information, ideas, and processes on a daily basis. Clear communication allows companies to run smoothly, helps everyday individuals utilize products, and decreases confusion and frustration (hopefully).</h2>
